# Colette: Coffee Roulette â€” pair with a random person for coffee

## Installation

Colette requires Python 3.9+. This can be obtained from [official Python distribution](https://python.org), or
[Annaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) but be aware of the
non-free licensing of the latter.

*Colette* is found on Github [dehorsley/colette](https://github.com/dehorsley/colette) and in the Python package system PyPI.

To install the package run the following code in the command line

    pip install colette

Once installed, make sure you have the correct files in your working directory.
Examples of the nesessary files can be found in the [test_data](https://github.com/dehorsley/colette/tree/main/tests/test_data).
To run a coffee roulette, you will need:

1)  A .csv file named `people.csv` with the following headings: 'name',
    'organisation', 'email', and 'active'. The `active` column binary (1 or true =
    active, 0 or false = inactive).  Other columns are unused, and can have any
    format. Each participating (or previously participating) player should be
    listed on an individual row. The "organisation" column can be used to indicated whatever grouping makes sense for your usecase.

2)  Templates: `buyer.template`, `excluded.template`,
    `organiser.template`. These are used when auto-generating emails to
    participants. They could look something like this (this is the
    `buyer.template`):

        Hi {{buyer.name}},
        This round of coffee roulette you've been paired with {{organiser.name}} from {{organiser.organisation}}.
        They will contact you to arrange a venue and time, your only job this month is to buy the coffee!

        Some things to talk about:

        1. What your current role is
        2. Where you've worked previously
        3. Where you'd like to work in the future
        4. The merits of 'Zoom-shirts'

        Happy networking!

        PS. Perhaps add {{organiser.email}} to your address book to make sure it doesn't get flagged as spam.

    Note: emails sent from colette are plain text, not HTML. *Colette* uses
    jinja2 for templates. Double curly brackets --- `{{}}` --- are replaced
    variables populated in the *people.csv* file. See the jinja2 documentation
    more detail.

3)  An `email.ini` file - this needs the following format:

        [email]
        from = Joe Bloggs <email.name@emailprovider.com>
        subject = Coffee Roulette
        server = 
        port = 
        ssl = true
        username = email.name@emailprovider.com
        password = thepasswordfortheaccount


4)  (Optional) A CSV file named `overrides.csv` with three columns: the names of the two people, and
    the the thids a number indicating penalty factor (eg 1000). The names in the first column will not
    be paired together. 

**Once you have these files, you're ready to go**

# Running the roulette

Once you have the files, and have installed *colette*, it's probably a good
idea to test the email functionality with your own address **before** doing an
official round as the `email` command automatically sends the emails out.

To generate a new round, run the following line: The active column should
contain 'true' if a player is going to participate in new rounds.

Run, from a command line in the directory of your previously created 'people.csv':

    colette new

> **Note**
> 
> You may need to add the path pip installed colette too to your PATH
> enviroment variable.
>
> Alternativly you can run colette as
>
>     python -m colette

This will generate a new `round\*.csv`, with pairs chosen to minimize the number
of people paired together in the same organisation, and those previously
paired. Players are assigned a role in each round, either "organiser" or
"(coffee) buyer". The method attempts to choose pairs that allow people to swap
roles each round.

If you want to mark certain pairs as desired or undesired, create an
`overrides.csv` file in the data directory, listing on each row the name of the
two players and an integer "cost" of adding this pair to the round. This will
be added to the cost of pairing if the players have previously been pair or are
in the same organisation. To prefer a pair, add a negative cost.

If successful, the following message will appear:

    Generating Round 1!

After you have generated a few rounds, some warning messages may appear such as:

    Bob Builder paired with Thomas Tank but players were the same role last round.

You could re-run the round, and add higher penalising factors if someone keeps
being the buyer for instance.

# Emailing participants

Once happy with the round, you are ready to email people. Make sure the
`*.template` files, and the `email.ini` file is correctly populated. Then, in
the command line, run:

    colette email

If successful, the following message will appear:

    Emailing players of round 1!

This step can take a minute or so. Once done, there's no extra message. But
hopefully your roulette participants will have received an email with their
coffee partner!

Happy rouletting. Any problems with program itself, file an issue
on the [Colette Github progject](https://github.com/dehorsley/colette).
